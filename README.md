## Meta Values
The meta value are associated with images manually, automated no image processing applied.
* Sometimes meta values are added in response to something featured in a new Community Highlights video
* Sometimes aspects of a Community Highlights entry weren't noticed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Notes
* Please edit [`data/highlights-meta-to-add.json`](data/highlights-meta-to-add.json)
    her than making changes to the various data files as portions of that process are already handled by the site
    builder.
* If you are not familiar with editing files on GitHub, please refer to
    [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository)
    before attempting to edit [`data/highlights-meta-to-add.json`](data/highlights-meta-to-add.json).
* Meta values are generally lower-case, community names preferred over actual names (e.g. "bean" instead of
    "Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing" or "Confusing Creature")

### Renaming an existing value
Please don't üòÖ. Please instead file an Issue to have a meta value changed.

### Adding meta values to images

1. Locate or add the JSON key for the new or current meta value, using a JSON array (`[]` for new values)
2. Find the image URL
	* The simplest way to check where an image came from may be to browse the
        [Community Highlights Archive website](https://communityhighlights.satisfactory.video/).
        If the highlights entry does not appear to have a source link (i.e. if it was extracted from the YouTube video),
		you may need to contact SignpostMarv on Discord or Twitter for the `yt-dlp`-style image link.
	* For Tweets:
      1. open the tweet (e.g. https://twitter.com/jembawls/status/1383101151814488068)
      2. open the image in the tweet that was used in the highlights entry in a new tab (e.g.
          https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzHDHAOXEAo-Y3T?format=jpg&name=small)
      3. Search the GitHub repo for the image id - the bit after `/media/` but before `?format` (e.g.
          https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ASatisfactory-Clips-Archive%2FCommunity-Highlights-Archive-Data%20EzHDHAOXEAo-Y3T&type=code)
      4. Copy the image url from the search results (e.g. `https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzHDHAOXEAo-Y3T.jpg`)
    * For Reddit posts (similar to the above Tweets example):
      1. Open the Reddit post
      2. Open the image from the Reddit post that was featured in the highlights entry in a new tab
      3. Search for the filename
      4. Copy the image url from the search results
3. Add the image URL to the appropriate JSON array
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each change to be made
5. Save/Commit/PR

#### Example
```json
{
	"some new meta value": [
		"https://i.reddit.it/some-reddit-image.png",
		"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/some-twitter-image.jpg",
		"yt-dlp/some-youtube-id@timestamp.png"
	],
	"some other meta value": [
		"https://i.reddit.it/some-reddit-image.png",
		"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/some-twitter-image.jpg",
		"yt-dlp/some-youtube-id@timestamp.png"
	]
}
```

# files

## `data/by-youtube-video`
YouTube video descriptions with chapter markers are in sub-folders for their YouTube video id with the prefix `yt-`,
	with the filename `desc.txt` e.g. `data/by-youtube-video/yt-Ny6KcOCdABM/desc.txt`

For Community Highlights not sourced from the Community Highlights Archive YouTube channel, the contents of `desc.txt`
	is preferred to match the format of YouTube chapter markers rather than the original video's description in the
	event there are no such chapter markers.

## `data/highlights-meta/`

### `data/highlights-meta/highlights-meta-history/`
Files in here represent the state of `data/highlights-meta.json` at a given point in its history. These are used by
	the gui in the site builder to flag which meta values were added since a given image was last signed off.

### `data/highlights-meta/twitter-tweet-manual-entry/`
Since the Twitter api changes, retrieval of Twitter api data is now a manual process.
* The files are processed by the site builder to fill in the gaps of the lost functionality.
* Filenames are the lowercase hexadecimal digest of the sha-512 hash of the tweet url.

### Example
#### Has images
`https://twitter.com/SoenKigi/status/1599976711445131264` resolves to
	`8148ef2b37d3cf8b72f10e05047e4b6833f8ce3e9b29f5fdffbb4da0b64269eadf34c68e20f23eb8e14556e9534b0cff4dc02eea6aa4902488493eb37ad02c5d.json`

```json
{
	"includes": {
		"media": [
			{
				"type": "photo",
				"url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjRCVs5XgAMOWH6.jpg"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

#### Tweet deleted since sourcing
```json
{
	"includes": {
		"media": []
	}
}
```

### `data/authors.json#aliased`
Creator names are not always consistently presented in `data/by-youtube-video/*/desc.txt`, due to (but not limited to):
* transcription error (one cannot generally copy/paste text from a video ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
* changes in casing or spelling across various social networks
